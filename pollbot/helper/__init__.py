Hello there!

My name is Arne Beer (@Nukesor) and I'm the sole developer of the Ultimate PollBot.

The whole project has been created during my leisure time and for free.
This project is non-profit, open-source on [Github](https://github.com/Nukesor/pollbot) and hosted on a server I'm renting from my own money.

I really appreciate anything that helps me out and that keeps me and my server running ☺️.

If you like this project, check my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/nukesor) or support me via [Paypal](https://www.paypal.me/arnebeer).

Have great day!
